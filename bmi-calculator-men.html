            <h2>How BMI Works for Men</h2>

            <p>
                Men generally have a higher percentage of muscle mass compared to women.
                Because muscle weighs more than fat, some men—especially athletes—may
                have a higher BMI even if their body fat percentage is low.
            </p>

            <p>
                This means that BMI should be used as a general guideline rather than a
                perfect measure of health. For most men, however, BMI provides a useful
                starting point for understanding weight-related health risks.
            </p>

            <!-- BMI CATEGORIES -->
            <h2>Understanding Your BMI Result</h2>

            <p>
                After calculating your BMI, you will see a numerical value that represents your
                Body Mass Index. This number helps determine whether your body weight is within
                a healthy range based on your height. For men, BMI is a useful starting point
                to understand overall weight-related health, although it does not directly
                measure body fat.
            </p>

            <p>
                Men generally have higher muscle mass compared to women, which means some men,
                especially those who are physically active or involved in strength training,
                may have a slightly higher BMI without having excess body fat. This is why BMI
                should always be interpreted along with lifestyle, fitness level, and overall
                health condition.
            </p>

            <h2>What Is a Healthy BMI for Men?</h2>

            <p>
                For adult men, a healthy BMI typically falls between <strong>18.5 and 24.9</strong>.
                Staying within this range is generally associated with a lower risk of
                weight-related health problems.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Underweight (BMI below 18.5):</strong> May indicate insufficient body weight and low energy levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Normal weight (BMI 18.5 – 24.9):</strong> Indicates a healthy balance between height and weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Overweight (BMI 25 – 29.9):</strong> May increase the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Obese (BMI 30 or above):</strong> Associated with a higher risk of serious health conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why BMI Is Important for Men’s Health</h2>

            <p>
                Checking your BMI regularly can help you become more aware of changes in your
                body weight over time. For men, maintaining a healthy BMI is important because
                excess body weight is often linked to conditions such as heart disease, type 2
                diabetes, joint problems, and reduced stamina.
            </p>

            <p>
                A BMI calculator for men is especially helpful for identifying early signs of
                unhealthy weight gain or weight loss, allowing you to take preventive action
                through better diet choices and physical activity.
            </p>

            <h2>Limitations of BMI for Men</h2>

            <p>
                Although BMI is widely used, it has certain limitations. It does not distinguish
                between muscle mass and body fat. As a result, men with a muscular build may fall
                into the overweight category even if they have low body fat.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a more complete health assessment, BMI should be considered along with other
                factors such as waist circumference, body fat percentage, physical activity
                level, and overall lifestyle habits.
            </p>

            <h2>Tips to Maintain a Healthy BMI</h2>

            <p>
                Maintaining a healthy BMI requires a balanced approach rather than extreme
                measures. Some simple and effective tips include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Eating a balanced diet with adequate protein, fruits, and vegetables</li>
                <li>Engaging in regular exercise, including both cardio and strength training</li>
                <li>Avoiding excessive consumption of processed foods and sugary drinks</li>
                <li>Getting enough sleep and managing daily stress</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Note</h2>

            <p>
                This BMI calculator for men is designed to provide a quick and easy way to assess
                your body weight status. It should be used as a general guideline rather than a
                medical diagnosis. If you have concerns about your health or BMI result, consulting
                a healthcare professional is always recommended.
            </p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

            <h3>What is a healthy BMI range for men?</h3>
            <p>
            For adult men, a healthy BMI range is generally between 18.5 and 24.9. This
            range is associated with a lower risk of weight-related health issues.
            </p>

            <h3>Does muscle mass affect BMI in men?</h3>
            <p>
            Yes, muscle mass can affect BMI results. Men with higher muscle mass may have
            a higher BMI even if they have low body fat, which is why BMI should be viewed
            as a general guideline.
            </p>

            <h3>Is BMI a reliable indicator of men’s health?</h3>
            <p>
            BMI is a useful screening tool, but it does not measure body fat, fitness, or
            overall health. Factors such as activity level and body composition should
            also be considered.
            </p>

            <h3>Can men with an athletic build rely on BMI?</h3>
            <p>
            Athletic men may fall into the overweight BMI category due to muscle mass.
            In such cases, BMI alone may not accurately reflect health status.
            </p>

            <h3>How often should men calculate their BMI?</h3>
            <p>
            Men can check their BMI every few months to monitor weight changes, especially
            when making lifestyle or fitness adjustments.
